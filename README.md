# PDF to Note

Essentially adds a lined section to the right of a slide for you to make notes on.

Auto adjusts to both horizontal and vertical slides to maximise space available.

TL;DR:  
```
------------------  ----------  
|                |  ----------  
|     Slide      |  --notes---  
|                |  ----------  
------------------  ----------
```

Personally used for note making while at uni.

# Usage

Make a folder called "in" at the same directory as your running program. Anything inside there in PDF form will be auto made into notes.
All finished slides will be in the "out" folder.
